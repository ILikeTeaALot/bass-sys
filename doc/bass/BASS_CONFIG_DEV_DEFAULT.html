<h1>BASS_CONFIG_DEV_DEFAULT config option</h1>
<p>Include a "Default" entry in the output device list?
<p><pre class="def">BASS_SetConfig(
    BASS_CONFIG_DEV_DEFAULT,
    BOOL <I>default</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>default<td>If TRUE, a "Default" device will be included in the device list.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
This option adds a "Default" entry to the output device list, which maps to the device that is currently the system's default. Its output will automatically switch over when the system's default device setting changes.
<p>When enabled, the "Default" device will also become the default device to <a href="BASS_Init.html">BASS_Init</a> (with <i>device = -1</i>). Both it and the device that it currently maps to will have the BASS_DEVICE_DEFAULT flag set by <a href="BASS_GetDeviceInfo.html">BASS_GetDeviceInfo</a>.
<p>This option is enabled by default, and can only be disabled before <a href="BASS_GetDeviceInfo.html">BASS_GetDeviceInfo</a> or <a href="BASS_Init.html">BASS_Init</a> has been called.
<p><h2>Platform-specific</h2>
This config option is only available on Windows and macOS; a "Default" entry is always included on other platforms. On Windows, the automatic device switching feature requires Windows Vista or above (Windows 7 when DirectSound is used). <a href="BASS_Init.html">BASS_Init</a> can be called with the BASS_DEVICE_REINIT flag to manually switch to the new default device on older Windows.
<p>When the "Default" device is used with DirectSound, the <a href="BASS_SetVolume.html">BASS_SetVolume</a> and <a href="BASS_GetVolume.html">BASS_GetVolume</a> functions work a bit differently to usual; they deal with the "session" volume, which only affects the current process's output on the device, rather than the device's volume.
