<h1>BASS_ATTRIB_MUSIC_SPEED attribute</h1>
<p>The speed of a MOD music.
<p><pre class="def">BASS_ChannelSetAttribute(
    HMUSIC <I>handle</I>,
    BASS_ATTRIB_MUSIC_SPEED,
    float <I>speed</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>handle<td>The MOD music handle.
<tr><td>speed<td>The speed... 0 (min) to 255 (max). This will be rounded down to a whole number.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
This attribute is a direct mapping of the MOD's speed, so the value can be changed via effects in the MOD itself.
<p>The "speed" is the number of ticks per row. Setting it to 0, stops and ends the music. Note that by changing this attribute, you are changing the playback length.
<p>During playback, the effect of changes to this attribute are not heard instantaneously, due to buffering. This latency can be reduced via the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_BUFFER.html">BASS_ATTRIB_BUFFER</a> attribute.
