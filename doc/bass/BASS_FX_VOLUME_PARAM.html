<h1>BASS_FX_VOLUME_PARAM structure</h1>
<p>Used with <a href="BASS_FXGetParameters.html">BASS_FXGetParameters</a> and <a href="BASS_FXSetParameters.html">BASS_FXSetParameters</a> to retrieve and set the parameters of a volume level effect.
<p><pre class="def">typedef struct {
    float <i>fTarget</i>;
    float <i>fCurrent</i>;
    float <i>fTime</i>;
    DWORD <i>lCurve</i>;
} BASS_FX_VOLUME_PARAM;</pre>
<p><h2>Members</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>fTarget<td>The new volume level... 0 = silent, 1.0 = normal, above 1.0 = amplification. The default value is 1.
<tr><td>fCurrent<td>The current volume level... -1 = leave existing current level when setting parameters. The default value is 1.
<tr><td>fTime<td>The time to take to transition from the current level to the new level, in seconds. The default value is 0.
<tr><td>lCurve<td>The curve to use in the transition... 0 = linear, 1 = logarithmic. The default value is 0.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
The <i>fTime</i> value is based on the channel's original sample rate. If the playback rate is changed via the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_FREQ.html">BASS_ATTRIB_FREQ</a> attribute, then the transition time that is heard will be affected accordingly.
<p>When retrieving parameters, the returned <i>fCurrent</i> value is the level that is currently being applied, not necessarily the level that was last set via <a href="BASS_FXSetParameters.html">BASS_FXSetParameters</a>. During playback, it may not be the value that is currently being heard, due to buffering.
<p>Unlike the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_VOL.html">BASS_ATTRIB_VOL</a> attribute, this effect modifies the channel's sample data, so it can be used to change the level of decoding channels and recording channels. The <a href="BASS_CONFIG_CURVE_VOL.html">BASS_CONFIG_CURVE_VOL</a> setting does not affect this effect; the <i>fTarget</i> and <i>fCurrent</i> values are always linear.
