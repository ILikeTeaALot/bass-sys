<tr><td>ctype<td>The type of channel it is, which can be one of the following.<br>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_CTYPE_SAMPLE<td>Sample channel. (HCHANNEL)
<tr><td>BASS_CTYPE_STREAM<td>User sample stream. This can also be used as a flag to test if the channel is any kind of HSTREAM.

<tr><td>BASS_CTYPE_STREAM_WAV<td>WAVE format flag. This can be used to test if the channel is any kind of WAVE format. The codec (the file's "wFormatTag") is specified in the LOWORD. Additional information is also avaliable from <a href="BASS_ChannelGetTags.html">BASS_ChannelGetTags</a> (BASS_TAG_WAVEFORMAT).
<tr><td>BASS_CTYPE_MUSIC_MOD<td>Generic MOD format music. This can also be used as a flag to test if the channel is any kind of HMUSIC.
<tr><td>BASS_CTYPE_MUSIC_MTM<td>MultiTracker format music.

</table>
<i>other channel types may be supported by add-ons, see the documentation.</i>
<tr><td>origres<td>The original resolution (bits per sample)... 0 = undefined. If the original sample format is floating-point then the BASS_ORIGRES_FLOAT flag will be set and the number of bits will be in the LOWORD.
<tr><td>plugin<td>The plugin that is handling the channel... 0 = not using a plugin. Note this is only available with streams created using the plugin system via the standard BASS stream creation functions, not those created by add-on functions. Information on the plugin can be retrieved via <a href="BASS_PluginGetInfo.html">BASS_PluginGetInfo</a>.
<tr><td>sample<td>The sample that is playing on the channel. Only applicable when <i>ctype</i> is BASS_CTYPE_SAMPLE or BASS_CTYPE_STREAM_SAMPLE.
<tr><td>filename<td>The filename associated with the channel. (HSTREAM only)
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
With a recording channel, the BASS_STREAM_DECODE flag indicates that it is not using a <a href="RECORDPROC.html">RECORDPROC</a> callback function.
<p>BASS supports 8/16/32-bit sample data, so if a WAV file, for example, uses another sample resolution, it will have to be converted by BASS. The <i>origres</i> member can be used to check what the resolution originally was.
<p><h2>Platform-specific</h2>
On Linux/macOS/iOS/Android, the BASS_UNICODE flag may not be present even if it was used in the stream's creation, as BASS will have translated the filename to the native UTF-8 form.
<p><h2>Example</h2>
Check if a channel is an MP3 stream.
<pre class="code">
BASS_CHANNELINFO info;
BASS_ChannelGetInfo(channel, &info); // get info
if (info.ctype == BASS_CTYPE_STREAM_MP3) {
    // it's an MP3!
}</pre>
