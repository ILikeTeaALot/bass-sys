<h1>BASSenc</h1>
<p>BASSenc allows BASS channels to be encoded using command-line encoders with STDIN support (LAME/OGGENC/etc), or ACM codecs (on Windows) or CoreAudio codecs (on macOS/iOS) or user-provided encoders. As well as writing to file, it can serve the encoded data to clients via Shoutcast and Icecast servers or directly. It can also write plain PCM/WAV files. BASSenc itself also has add-ons available for FLAC / MP3 / Ogg Vorbis / OPUS encoding. They can be downloaded from the BASS website: <a href=http://www.un4seen.com target=_blank>www.un4seen.com</a>
<p>The BASSENC.CHM file should be copied into the same directory as this file (BASS.CHM), to be able to conveniently access the BASSenc documentation from within this BASS documentation.
