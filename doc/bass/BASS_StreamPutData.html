<h1>BASS_StreamPutData</h1>
<p>Adds sample data to a "push" stream.
<p><pre class="def">DWORD BASS_StreamPutData(
    HSTREAM <I>handle</I>,
    void *<I>buffer</I>,
    DWORD <I>length</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>handle<td>The stream handle.
<tr><td>buffer<td>Pointer to the sample data... NULL = allocate space in the queue buffer so that there is at least <i>length</i> bytes of free space.
<tr><td>length<td>The amount of data in bytes, optionally using the BASS_STREAMPROC_END flag to signify the end of the stream. 0 can be used to just check how much data is queued.
</table>
<p><h2>Return value</h2>
If successful, the amount of data currently queued is returned, else -1 is returned. Use <a href="BASS_ErrorGetCode.html">BASS_ErrorGetCode</a> to get the error code.
<p><h2>Error codes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_HANDLE<td><I>handle</I> is not valid.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_NOTAVAIL<td>The stream is not using the push system.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_ILLPARAM<td><I>length</I> is not valid, it must equate to a whole number of samples.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_ENDED<td>The stream has ended.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_MEM<td>There is insufficient memory or the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_PUSH_LIMIT.html">BASS_ATTRIB_PUSH_LIMIT</a> limit is exceeded.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
As much data as possible will be placed in the stream's playback buffer, and any remainder will be queued for when more space becomes available, ie. as the buffered data is played. With a decoding channel, there is no playback buffer, so all data is queued in that case. The queue buffer will be automatically enlarged as required to hold the provided data, but it can also be enlarged in advance via this function (with <i>buffer = NULL</i>). By default, there is no limit to how large the buffer can get (besides available memory), but that can be changed via the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_PUSH_LIMIT.html">BASS_ATTRIB_PUSH_LIMIT</a> attribute. The queue buffer is freed when the stream ends or is reset, eg. via <a href="BASS_ChannelPlay.html">BASS_ChannelPlay</a> (restart = TRUE) or <a href="BASS_ChannelSetPosition.html">BASS_ChannelSetPosition</a> (pos = 0).
<p>DSP/FX are applied when the data reaches the playback buffer, or the <a href="BASS_ChannelGetData.html">BASS_ChannelGetData</a> call in the case of a decoding channel.
<p>Data should be provided at a rate sufficent to sustain playback. If the buffer gets exhausted, BASS will automatically stall playback of the stream, until more data is provided. <a href="BASS_ChannelGetData.html">BASS_ChannelGetData</a> (BASS_DATA_AVAILABLE) can be used to check the playback buffer level, and <a href="BASS_ChannelIsActive.html">BASS_ChannelIsActive</a> can be used to check if playback has stalled. A BASS_SYNC_STALL sync can also be set via <a href="BASS_ChannelSetSync.html">BASS_ChannelSetSync</a>, to be triggered upon playback stalling or resuming.
