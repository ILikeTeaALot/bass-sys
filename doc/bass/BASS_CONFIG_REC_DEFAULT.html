<h1>BASS_CONFIG_REC_DEFAULT config option</h1>
<p>Include a "Default" entry in the recording device list?
<p><pre class="def">BASS_SetConfig(
    BASS_CONFIG_REC_DEFAULT,
    BOOL <I>default</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>default<td>If TRUE, a "Default" device will be included in the device list.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
This option adds a "Default" entry to the recording device list, which maps to the device that is currently the system's default. Its input will automatically switch over when the system's default device setting changes.
<p>When enabled, the "Default" device will also become the default device to <a href="BASS_RecordInit.html">BASS_RecordInit</a> (with <i>device = -1</i>). Both it and the device that it currently maps to will have the BASS_DEVICE_DEFAULT flag set by <a href="BASS_RecordGetDeviceInfo.html">BASS_RecordGetDeviceInfo</a>.
<p>This option is enabled by default, and can only be disabled before <a href="BASS_RecordGetDeviceInfo.html">BASS_RecordGetDeviceInfo</a> or <a href="BASS_RecordInit.html">BASS_RecordInit</a> has been called.
<p><h2>Platform-specific</h2>
This config option is only available on Windows and macOS; a "Default" entry is always included on other platforms. On Windows, the automatic device switching feature requires using WASAPI (not DirectSound) for recording.
