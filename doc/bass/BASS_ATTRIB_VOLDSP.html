<h1>BASS_ATTRIB_VOLDSP attribute</h1>
<p>The volume level applied in the DSP chain of a channel.
<p><pre class="def">BASS_ChannelSetAttribute(
    DWORD <I>handle</I>,
    BASS_ATTRIB_VOLDSP,
    float <I>volume</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>handle<td>The channel handle.
<tr><td>volume<td>The volume level... 0 = silent, 1.0 = normal, above 1.0 = amplification.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
Unlike <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_VOL.html">BASS_ATTRIB_VOL</a>, this attribute does have direct effect on decoding/recording channels and is present in the sample data returned by <a href="BASS_ChannelGetData.html">BASS_ChannelGetData</a>, because it is applied in the channel's DSP chain. By default, the effect is applied at the start of the DSP chain, so that it is present in the data received by all DSP/FX, but that can be changed via the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_VOLDSP_PRIORITY.html">BASS_ATTRIB_VOLDSP_PRIORITY</a> attribute.
<p>During playback, the effect of changes to this attribute are not heard instantaneously due to buffering. This latency can be reduced via the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_BUFFER.html">BASS_ATTRIB_BUFFER</a> attribute, but it is generally better to use the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_VOL.html">BASS_ATTRIB_VOL</a> attribute instead for playback volume control.
<p>Multiple DSP volume controls and ramping/fading are possible with the BASS_FX_VOLUME effect via <a href="BASS_ChannelSetFX.html">BASS_ChannelSetFX</a>.
