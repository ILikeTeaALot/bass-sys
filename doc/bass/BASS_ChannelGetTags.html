<p><h2>Return value</h2>
If successful, the requested tags are returned, else NULL is returned. Use <a href="BASS_ErrorGetCode.html">BASS_ErrorGetCode</a> to get the error code.
<p><h2>Error codes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_HANDLE<td><I>handle</I> is not valid.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_NOTAVAIL<td>The requested tags are not available.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
Some tags (eg. ID3v1) are located at the end of the file, so when streaming a file from the internet, the tags will not be available until the download is complete. A BASS_SYNC_DOWNLOAD sync can be set via <a href="BASS_ChannelSetSync.html">BASS_ChannelSetSync</a>, to be informed of when the download is complete. A BASS_SYNC_META sync can be used to be informed of new Shoutcast metadata, and a BASS_SYNC_OGG_CHANGE sync for when a new logical bitstream begins in a chained OGG stream, which generally brings new OGG tags.
<p>In a chained OGG file containing multiple bitstreams, each bitstream will have its own tags. To get the tags from a particular one, <a href="BASS_ChannelSetPosition.html">BASS_ChannelSetPosition</a> can be first used to seek to it.
<p>When a Media Foundation codec is in use, the BASS_TAG_WAVEFORMAT tag can be used to find out what the source format is, eg. via the WAVEFORMATEX structure's wFormatTag member. Some typical wFormatTag examples are: 0x0161 = WMA, 0x0162 = WMA pro, 0x0163 = WMA lossless, 0x1610 = AAC.
<p>MP4 metadata can include a "Genre" tag that is either text or a number. When a number, it is an ID3v1 genre list index +1, eg. 1 = Blues, 2 = Classic Rock, etc. The full list can be found at <a href="https://id3.org/id3v2.3.0#Appendix_A_-_Genre_List_from_ID3v1" target=_blank>id3.org</a>.
<p>The returned tag's memory is owned by BASS (or an add-on) and should not be modified. It should also not be accessed after the channel has been freed. If longer-term access is needed, a copy should be made.
<p><h2>Example</h2>
List an OGG stream's comments.
<pre class="code">
const char *comments = BASS_ChannelGetTags(channel, BASS_TAG_OGG); // get a pointer to the 1st comment
if (comments)
    while (*comments) {
        printf("%s\n", comments); // display the comment
        comments += strlen(comments) + 1; // move on to next comment
    }
</pre>
<p>List a MOD music's samples.
<pre class="code">
const char *text;
int n = 0;
while (text = BASS_ChannelGetTags(channel, BASS_TAG_MUSIC_SAMPLE + n)) {
    printf("sample %d = %s\n", n + 1, text); // display the sample text
    n++; // move on to next sample
}
</pre>
