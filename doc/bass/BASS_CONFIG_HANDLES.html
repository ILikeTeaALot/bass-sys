<h1>BASS_CONFIG_HANDLES config option</h1>
<p>Number of existing HMUSIC / HRECORD / HSAMPLE / HSTREAM handles.
<p><pre class="def">BASS_GetConfig(
    BASS_CONFIG_HANDLES
);</pre>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
This is a read-only config option that gives the total number of HMUSIC / HRECORD / HSAMPLE / HSTREAM handles that currently exist, which can be useful for detecting leaks, ie. unfreed handles. Some add-ons may create their own handles for internal usage, so a single stream can increase (and decrease when freed) the total number of handles by more than one.
