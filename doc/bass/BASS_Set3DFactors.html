<h1>BASS_Set3DFactors</h1>
<p>Sets the factors that affect the calculations of 3D sound.
<p><pre class="def">BOOL BASS_Set3DFactors(
    float <I>distf</I>,
    float <I>rollf</I>,
    float <I>doppf</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>distf<td>The distance factor... 0 or less = leave current... examples: 1.0 = use meters, 0.9144 = use yards, 0.3048 = use feet. By default BASS measures distances in meters, you can change this setting if you are using a different unit of measurement.
<tr><td>rollf<td>The rolloff factor, how fast the sound quietens with distance... 0.0 (min) - 10.0 (max), less than 0.0 = leave current... examples: 0.0 = no rolloff, 1.0 = real world, 2.0 = 2x real.
<tr><td>doppf<td>The doppler factor... 0.0 (min) - 10.0 (max), less than 0.0 = leave current... examples: 0.0 = no doppler, 1.0 = real world, 2.0 = 2x real. The doppler effect is the way a sound appears to change pitch when it is moving towards or away from you. The listener and sound velocity settings are used to calculate this effect, this <I>doppf</I> value can be used to lessen or exaggerate the effect.
</table>
<p><h2>Return value</h2>
If successful, then TRUE is returned, else FALSE is returned. Use <a href="BASS_ErrorGetCode.html">BASS_ErrorGetCode</a> to get the error code.
<p><h2>Error codes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_INIT<td><a href="BASS_Init.html">BASS_Init</a> has not been successfully called.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_NO3D<td>The device was not initialized with 3D support.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
As with all 3D functions, use <a href="BASS_Apply3D.html">BASS_Apply3D</a> to apply the changes.
<p>When using multiple devices, the current thread's device setting (as set with <a href="BASS_SetDevice.html">BASS_SetDevice</a>) determines which device this function call applies to.
<p><h2>Example</h2>
Use yards as the distance measurement unit, while leaving the current rolloff and doppler factors untouched.
<pre class="code">BASS_Set3DFactors(0.9144, -1.0, -1.0);
BASS_Apply3D(); // apply the change</pre>
