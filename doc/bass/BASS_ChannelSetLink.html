<h1>BASS_ChannelSetLink</h1>
<p>Links two MOD music or stream channels together.
<p><pre class="def">BOOL BASS_ChannelSetLink(
    DWORD <I>handle</I>,
    DWORD <I>chan</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>handle<td>The channel handle... a HMUSIC or HSTREAM.
<tr><td>chan<td>The handle of the channel to have linked with it... a HMUSIC or HSTREAM.
</table>
<p><h2>Return value</h2>
If successful, then TRUE is returned, else FALSE is returned. Use <a href="BASS_ErrorGetCode.html">BASS_ErrorGetCode</a> to get the error code.
<p><h2>Error codes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_HANDLE<td>At least one of <I>handle</I> and <i>chan</i> is not a valid channel.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_DECODE<td>At least one of <I>handle</I> and <i>chan</i> is a decoding channel, so cannot be linked.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_UNKNOWN<td>Some other mystery problem!
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
Linked channels are started/stopped/paused/resumed together. Linked channels on the same device are guaranteed to start playing simultaneously. Links are one-way: channel <i>chan</i> will be started by channel <i>handle</i>, but not vice versa unless another link has been set in that direction.
<p>If a linked channel has reached the end, it will not be restarted when a channel it is linked to is started. If you want a linked channel to be restarted, you will need to have resetted its position using <a href="BASS_ChannelSetPosition.html">BASS_ChannelSetPosition</a> beforehand.
<p><h2>Example</h2>
Link 2 streams and play them together.
<pre class="code">
BASS_ChannelSetLink(stream1, stream2); // link stream2 to stream1
BASS_ChannelStart(stream1); // start both streams together
</pre>
