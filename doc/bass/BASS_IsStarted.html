<h1>BASS_IsStarted</h1>
<p>Checks if the output has been started and is active.
<p><pre class="def">DWORD BASS_IsStarted();</pre>
<p><h2>Return value</h2>
If the device has not been started, then 0 is returned. If the device has been started, then 1 is returned if it is currently active and 2 is returned if it is inactive (nothing is playing and <a href="BASS_CONFIG_DEV_NONSTOP.html">BASS_CONFIG_DEV_NONSTOP</a> is disabled).
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
When using multiple devices, the current thread's device setting (as set with <a href="BASS_SetDevice.html">BASS_SetDevice</a>) determines which device this function call applies to.
<p><h2>Platform-specific</h2>
On iOS, the return value may be 3 to indicate that the app's audio is currently interrupted, but only if the output was started prior to the interruption.
