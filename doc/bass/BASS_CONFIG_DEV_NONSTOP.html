<h1>BASS_CONFIG_DEV_NONSTOP config option</h1>
<p>Do not stop the output device when nothing is playing on it?
<p><pre class="def">BASS_SetConfig(
    BASS_CONFIG_DEV_NONSTOP,
    BOOL <I>nonstop</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>nonstop<td>If TRUE, sample data will continue to be sent to the output device while nothing is playing.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
By default, BASS will stop sending data to the output device when nothing is playing, to save a little CPU/power. When that happens, the device buffer will become empty, and the next playback will begin more quickly as a result. Or it may be delayed if the device has gone to sleep in the meantime. If more consistent playback latency (around the value given by <a href="BASS_GetInfo.html">BASS_GetInfo</a>) is wanted, this option can be enabled to keep the device buffer filled with silence when nothing is playing. The output will still be stopped by <a href="BASS_Stop.html">BASS_Stop</a> then.
