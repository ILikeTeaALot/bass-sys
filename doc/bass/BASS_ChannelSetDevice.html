<h1>BASS_ChannelSetDevice</h1>
<p>Changes the device that a stream, MOD music or sample is using.
<p><pre class="def">BOOL BASS_ChannelSetDevice(
    DWORD <I>handle</I>,
    DWORD <I>device</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>handle<td>The channel or sample handle... a HMUSIC, HSTREAM or HSAMPLE.
<tr><td>device<td>The device to use... 0 = no sound, 1 = first real output device, BASS_NODEVICE = no device.
</table>
<p><h2>Return value</h2>
If successful, TRUE is returned, else FALSE is returned and the channel remains on its current device. Use <a href="BASS_ErrorGetCode.html">BASS_ErrorGetCode</a> to get the error code.
<p><h2>Error codes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_HANDLE<td><I>handle</I> is not a valid channel.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_DEVICE<td><i>device</i> is invalid.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_INIT<td>The requested device has not been initialized.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_NOTAVAIL<td>Only decoding channels are allowed to use the BASS_NODEVICE option. Final output mix streams (using STREAMPROC_DEVICE) cannot be moved to another device.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
When changing a sample's device, all the sample's existing channels (HCHANNELs) are freed. It is not possible to change the device of an individual sample channel.
<p>The BASS_NODEVICE option can be used to disassociate a decoding channel from a device, so that it does not get freed when <a href="BASS_Free.html">BASS_Free</a> is called.
