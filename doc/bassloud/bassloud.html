=================
BASSloud is an extension to the BASS audio library, providing loudness
measurement of BASS channels.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required.


Using BASSloud
==============
The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSloud and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSLOUD.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSloud documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.
