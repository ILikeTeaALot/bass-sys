<h1>BASS_CD_Analog_PlayFile</h1>
<p>Starts analog playback of an audio CD track, using a CDA file on the CD.
<p><pre class="def">DWORD BASS_CD_Analog_PlayFile(
    char *<I>file</I>,
    DWORD <I>pos</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>file<td>The CDA filename... for example, "D:\Track01.cda".
<tr><td>pos<td>Position in frames to start playback from. There are 75 frames per second.
</table>
<p><h2>Return value</h2>
If successful, the number of the drive being used is returned, else -1 is returned. Use <a href="mk:@MSITStore:bass.chm::/BASS_ErrorGetCode.html">BASS_ErrorGetCode</a> to get the error code.
<p><h2>Error codes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_FILEOPEN<td>The file could not be opened.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_FILEFORM<td>The file was not recognised as a CDA file.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_DEVICE<td>The drive could not be found.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_POSITION<td><I>pos</I> is invalid.
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_UNKNOWN<td>Some other mystery problem!
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
Some old CD drives may not be able to digitally extract audio data (or not quickly enough to sustain playback), so that it is not possible to use <a href="BASS_CD_StreamCreate.html">BASS_CD_StreamCreate</a> to stream CD tracks. This is where the analog playback option can come in handy.<p>
<p>In analog playback, the sound bypasses BASS; it goes directly from the CD drive to the soundcard (assuming the drive is cabled up to the soundcard). This means that BASS output does not need to be initialized to use analog playback. It also means it is not possible to apply any DSP/FX to the sound, and nor is it possible to visualise it (unless you record the sound from the soundcard).
<p>Analog playback is not possible while digital streaming is in progress; the streaming will kill the analog playback. So if you wish to switch from digital to analog playback, you should first free the stream using <a href="mk:@MSITStore:bass.chm::/BASS_StreamFree.html">BASS_StreamFree</a>.
