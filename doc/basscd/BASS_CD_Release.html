<p><h2>Parameters</h2>

<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_DEVICE<td><i>drive</i> is invalid.

<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
When using the SPTI interface, some applications may require BASSCD to release a CD drive before the app is able to use it. After a drive has been released, BASSCD will attempt to re-acquire it in the next BASSCD function call made on it.
