);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>

</table>
<p><h2>Return value</h2>
TRUE is returned if the door is open, else FALSE is returned.

It is not possible to get the drive's current door status via the WIO interface. So the last known status will be returned in that case, which may not be accurate if the door has been opened or closed by another application, or manually.
