<h1>BASS_ATTRIB_SPLIT_ASYNCPERIOD attribute</h1>
<p>Maximum amount of data to asynchronously buffer at a time from a splitter's source.
<p><pre class="def">BASS_ChannelSetAttribute(
    HSTREAM <I>handle</I>,
    BASS_ATTRIB_SPLIT_ASYNCPERIOD,
    float <I>period</I>
);</pre>
<p><h2>Parameters</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>handle<td>The splitter stream handle.
<tr><td>period<td>The maximum amount to data to asynchronously buffer at a time from the source, in seconds... 0 = as much as possible.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
When asynchronous buffering is enabled via the <a href="BASS_ATTRIB_SPLIT_ASYNCBUFFER.html">BASS_ATTRIB_SPLIT_ASYNCBUFFER</a> attribute, this attribute limits how much data is requested from the source at a time. When there is more space available in the buffer, the request will be repeated until the space is filled.
<p>The setting applies to all splitter streams that have the same source. The default setting is 0 (as much as possible). Changes take immediate effect.
