<p><h2>Error codes</h2>
<table>
<tr><td>BASS_ERROR_INIT<td><a href="BASS_WASAPI_Init.html">BASS_WASAPI_Init</a> has not been successfully called.
</table>
<p><h2>Remarks</h2>
Locking a device prevents other threads from accessing the device buffer, including a <a href="WASAPIPROC.html">WASAPIPROC</a>. Other threads wanting to access a locked device will block until it is unlocked, so a device should only be locked very briefly. A device must be unlocked in the same thread that it was locked.
